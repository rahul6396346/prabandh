# Leave Balance Display Issue - Fix Documentation

## Problem
The leave balance display in the frontend was showing static default values (15, 10, 12, etc.) instead of dynamic user-specific remaining balances.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Excessive Polling Frequency**: The usePoll hook was set to 100ms interval, causing potential performance issues and rate limiting
2. **Poor Error Handling**: API failures were silently caught and fallback values were returned without proper error reporting
3. **Authentication Issues**: Inconsistent token handling in API requests
4. **Default Backend Values**: The backend was correctly returning default leave allocations, but these appeared as static values

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Polling Frequency
```typescript
// Before: 100ms (excessive)
interval: 100

// After: 30 seconds (reasonable)
interval: 30000
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive logging with emojis for easy debugging
- Added user-facing error messages for API failures
- Improved error handling in both frontend service and component
- Added validation for API response structure

### 3. Improved Authentication
- Enhanced token logging and validation
- Better error messages for authentication failures
- Added detailed debugging information for auth token availability

### 4. Added Debug Panel
Added a real-time debug panel to monitor:
- Last update timestamp
- Polling status
- Loading state
- Sample balance values

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend/prabandhserver
python manage.py runserver
```

### 2. Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Use Debug Script
```bash
python test_leave_balance_api.py
```

### 4. Browser Console Debugging
Open browser developer tools and look for:
- üîÑ API call logs
- ‚úÖ Successful responses
- ‚ùå Error messages
- üîê Authentication token status

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for the new emoji-prefixed logs to track API calls
2. **Monitor Debug Panel**: The blue debug panel shows real-time status
3. **Verify Balance Updates**: Leave balance should update after applying/canceling leaves
4. **Test Error Handling**: Try with invalid tokens to see error messages

## Expected Behavior

- **Initial Load**: Leave balance fetches immediately when component mounts
- **Polling**: Updates every 30 seconds automatically
- **Manual Refresh**: Click "Manual Refresh" button for immediate update
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for API failures
- **Authentication**: Proper token validation and error reporting

## API Response Structure

The backend returns leave balance in this format:
```json
{
  "earned": { "total": 15, "used": 0, "remaining": 15 },
  "casual": { "total": 15, "used": 2, "remaining": 13 },
  "medical": { "total": 12, "used": 1, "remaining": 11 },
  "compensatory": { "total": 8, "used": 0, "remaining": 8 },
  "semester": { "total": 5, "used": 0, "remaining": 5 },
  "maternity": { "total": 15, "used": 0, "remaining": 15 },
  "paternity": { "total": 10, "used": 0, "remaining": 10 },
  "extraordinary": { "total": 15, "used": 0, "remaining": 15 },
  "academic": { "total": 5, "used": 0, "remaining": 5 },
  "half_pay": { "total": 5, "used": 0, "remaining": 5 },
  "duty": { "total": 15, "used": 0, "remaining": 15 }
}
```

## Leave Allocation Updates

### Recent Changes:
- **Paternity Leave**: Updated from 0 to 10 days
- **Duty Leave**: Confirmed as 15 days (no change needed)

### Current Leave Allocations:
- Casual Leave: 15 days
- Medical Leave: 12 days  
- Compensatory Leave: 8 days
- Earned Leave: 15 days
- Semester Leave: 5 days
- Maternity Leave: 15 days
- **Paternity Leave: 10 days** ‚≠ê (Updated)
- Extraordinary Leave: 15 days
- Academic Leave: 5 days
- Half Pay Leave: 5 days
- **Duty Leave: 15 days** ‚≠ê (Confirmed)

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still showing static values
**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Check authentication tokens in localStorage
3. Verify backend server is running on port 8000
4. Check browser console for error messages

### Issue: "Loading..." never stops
**Solutions:**
1. Check network tab for failed API calls
2. Verify authentication tokens
3. Check backend server logs
4. Ensure CORS is properly configured

### Issue: Polling not working
**Solutions:**
1. Check the debug panel shows "Polling: Enabled"
2. Verify no JavaScript errors in console
3. Check if component unmounts/remounts frequently

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `src/pages/faculty/leave/apply-form.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and debugging
- `src/services/leaveService.ts` - Improved API error handling and logging

### Backend
- No backend changes required - the API was working correctly

### New Files
- `test_leave_balance_api.py` - Debug script for testing API endpoints
- This documentation file

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced API polling from 100ms to 30 seconds (300x improvement)
- Added silent polling to prevent UI flicker
- Better error boundaries to prevent component crashes
- Optimized re-renders with proper state management
